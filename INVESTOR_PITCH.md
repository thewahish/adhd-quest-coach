# Quest Coach - Investor Pitch

## Executive Summary

**Quest Coach** is a gamified life management platform designed specifically for the 366 million adults worldwide living with ADHD. By transforming daily tasks into RPG-style quests, we make productivity engaging, manageable, and rewarding for neurodivergent individuals who struggle with traditional task management systems.

### The Ask
Seeking $250K seed funding for 12-month runway to:
- Build full-stack web and mobile applications
- Integrate AI-powered coaching features
- Launch beta with 1,000 users
- Validate unit economics and achieve product-market fit

## The Problem

### 366M Adults with ADHD Struggle Daily

**Traditional productivity apps fail ADHD users because:**
- ❌ Overwhelming interfaces with too many features
- ❌ Rigid systems that don't adapt to executive dysfunction
- ❌ No emotional/mental health tracking
- ❌ Punishment-based reminders that create anxiety
- ❌ One-size-fits-all approach

**The consequences:**
- 60% of ADHD adults are unemployed or underemployed
- 2-3x higher divorce rates
- $143B annual cost to US economy in lost productivity
- Existing productivity apps have <5% retention for ADHD users

### Current Alternatives Fall Short

| Solution | Price | Issues for ADHD Users |
|----------|-------|----------------------|
| Purpose App | $79.99/year | Generic, not ADHD-specific |
| Todoist | $48/year | Too complex, overwhelming |
| Habitica | $48/year | Outdated UI, lacks personalization |
